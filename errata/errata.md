### Chapter 1

- Theorem 1.2: should say "The sample median minimises the SAE" (not the SSE).

### Chapter 2

- In Section 2.3, consequence (2) of the axioms of probability should
say $P\{\emptyset\}=0$ not $P\{0\} = 0$.
- In Example 2.5, $\binom{20, 3} =$ should be $\binom{20}{3} = .$
- In Section 2.5, in paragraph before display $\frac{2}{3} = \ldots$, $nA$
should be $n_A$.
- In Section 2.5.1, in the definition of conditional probability,
$P{B|A}$ is missing brackets: it should read $P\{B|A\}$.
- In Example 2.11, the denominator is missing in the expresssion following the first equals sign.
It should read \[P \{\text{$64$ GB}|\text{$16$ MP}\} =
  \frac{P \{\text{$64$ GB} \cap \text{$16$ MP}\}}{P\{\text{$16$ MP}\}}.\]
- In Example 2.13, the market share for C Windows in the table is
30%, not 50%.
- In Example 2.14, in the displayed equation, $B1$, $B2$ and $B3$ should
be $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$.

### Chapter 3

- In the example just before Theorem 3.1, $E(X^2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx$, not $\int_{-\infty}{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx$.
- In the proof of Theorem 3.1, the equation for the total probability
is 1 property should be 
$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f (x)dx = 1$ not $-\infty f (x)dx = 1$.
- In Example 3.9, the probability $P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)$ should be
\[(0.99)^{10} + 10(0.01)^1 (0.99)^9\]
not
\[(0.99)10 + 10(0.01)1 (0.99)9.\]
