### Chapter 2

- The denominator in the statement of Theorem 2.1 (Bayes' theorem) 
should be $P\{A\}$, not $P\{B\} P\{A \mid B\}$. The
correct version of Bayes' theorem is:
\[P \{B |A\} = \frac{P \{B \}P \{A|B \}}{P \{A\}}.\]

### Chapter 3

- In Section 3.2.5, instead of 
$P(c < X < d) = F(d) - F(c)$, change $<d$ for $\leq d$, to give $P(c < X \leq d) = F(d) - F(c)$.
- In Section 3.2.4, in the formula for $\operatorname{Var}(X)$, $q$ should be $1-p$.

### Chapter 4

- In Example 4.9, the final confidence interval computed is a 99% interval, not a 90% interval.
